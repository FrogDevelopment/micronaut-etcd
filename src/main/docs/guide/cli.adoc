https://etcd.org/[etcd] integration is supported. Micronaut will create several kind of client to connect to
an existing etcd server cluster.

Add the Micronaut etcd module as a dependency:

[source,gradle]
dependency:io.micronaut.etcd:micronaut-etcd::{version}[]

The minimal configuration to use etcd clients is to simply declare `etcd:` with end endpoints of the
etcd cluster (example below).

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  endpoints: ['121.0.0.1:2379']
----
